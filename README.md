# Functional Data Structures in Haskell

## (Old project from the dark ages)

Old repo from when I was learning to code. I wrote this (and the other which were never uploaded) as part of an excuse to learn and get experience with Haskell. It's essentially some reimplementations of common data structures while I was learning the standard functionaal / immutable / Haskell-y way.
