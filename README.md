# Functional Data Structures in Haskell

## (Old project from the dark ages)

Old repo from when I was learning to code. I wrote this (and the other which were never uploaded) as part of an excuse to learn and get experience with Haskell. It's essentially some reimplementations of common data structures using the standard functional, immutable / Haskell way.
